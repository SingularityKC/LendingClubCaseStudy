## Conclusions
We have seen the driving Factors in the Previous Slides, The final Recommendation are as follows

Loan applicants whose annual income falls between 0 to 20,000 and if the Subgrade is F5,G2 or G3 then there is high chance that these applicants could become potential charge off’s

We see a risk of charge off when the purpose of loan is small business also if the time horizon to pay this loan amount is less than 36 months on the contrary if the loan purpose is wedding or vehicle loan (car) then the these tend to be good loans.

Loan applicants who are living in a rented house or those paying mortgage are more likely to be charge off. Home owners seem to have the least charge off ratio

The most risky loans Tend To BE of those applicants WHO are paying mortgage or rent and their Loan purpose is listed as small business and their sub grades fall under F5, G2 or G3, along with these factors if the interest rate is also higher then there is high chance of charge off.
